# Zoom-Automation
Using selenium and pyautogui library it helps to attend the meeting on zoom app.
By using getdata.py the user can convert excel sheet of our uni class time table into a json file.
auto.py imports the json file data.txt and then helps you login
ex.python3 auto3.py 1 #login to class 1
Final thanks to @DhanushKamath for lending his getdata.py.
